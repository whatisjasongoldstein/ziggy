    <h1>Precedent</h1>
    <p>DC has never had a canine public official before, although there are many dogs working as public servants in emergency services.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile a cat has been the Mayor of XXXX, Alaska for several years.</p>
    <p>We believe Mr. Ziggy can bridge the gap between longtime District residents, who love their dogs, and the millenial yuppies who <i>really</i> love their dogs and refer to them as ‚Äùfur babies‚Äù unironically.<sup>*</sup></p>

        Mr. Ziggy takes no position on whether dogs should be called ‚Äùfur babies.‚Äù His owners think this is stupid.
