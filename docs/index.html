<p>DC has never had a canine public official before, although there are many dogs working as public servants in emergency services.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a cat named Stubbs has been the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cat-mayor-alaska-town-15-years-article-1.1116263">Mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska for 15 years</a>. Mayor Stubbs has declined to endorse Mr. Ziggy because Ziggy barks at cats.</p>
<p>We believe Mr. Ziggy can bridge the gap between longtime District residents, who love their dogs, and the millenial yuppies who <em>really</em> love their dogs and refer to them as ‚Äùfur babies‚Äù unironically.<sup>*</sup></p></p>

    * Mr. Ziggy takes no position on whether dogs should be called ‚Äùfur babies.‚Äù His owners think this is stupid.
