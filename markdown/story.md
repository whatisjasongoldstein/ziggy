# Ziggyâ€™s story

Ziggy was born in a shelter in West Virginia but escaped hardship after being adopted through the [City Dogs Rescue](https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/) foster network. He graduated from Spot On Training University, despite incessantly barking in class.

Known for his floppy ears and signature sea lion bark, Ziggy immediately became a popular fixture of Shaw. He could be found defending the neighborhood from squirrels and poking his nose into local businesses to see if they have any treats.

Inspired by public outcry that [forced the city to legalize dogs on patios](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/07/20/dogs-dining-on-patios-are-illegal-interlopers-no-more), Ziggy entered politics with an aggressive paws on the ground campaign, defeating the incumbant, Muriel Bowser, who is not a puppy.

He's lead DC through the pandemic, mass protests, and an insurrection with his nose to the ground, and won't rest until the city works for all citizens, pointy-eared and floppy-eared alike.
