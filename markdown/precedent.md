DC has never had a canine public official before, although there are many dogs working as public servants in emergency services.

Meanwhile a cat named Stubbs has been the [Mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska for 15 years](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cat-mayor-alaska-town-15-years-article-1.1116263). Mayor Stubbs has declined to endorse Mr. Ziggy because Ziggy barks at cats.

We believe Mr. Ziggy can bridge the gap between longtime District residents, who love their dogs, and the millennial yuppies who *really* love their dogs and refer to them as ”fur babies” unironically.<sup>\*</sup></p>

    * Mr. Ziggy takes no position on whether dogs should be called ”fur babies.” His owners think this is stupid.
