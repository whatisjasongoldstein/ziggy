BREAKING: Ziggy, who is running for Mayor as a Repuplican, also misspoke when he said “Arp! Arp arp!” He meant to say he was going to take a giant shit in that hotel by the FBI building. #VoteZiggy #FloppyEars

Ziggy, who is running for DC Mayor, is exhausted after stopping by every storefront on 14th St. as part of his new "paws on the ground" campaign to build support from local businesses.

Or just because most of them smell like food.

It's hard to tell.

Larry Goldstein Floppy ears are good for listening. I am confident Ziggy will surround himself with the best advisors. #VoteZiggy

Jason Goldstein He is excellent at hearing. Listening... depends. Which means he won’t be captive to special interests unless they happen to be golden retrievers.

After losing to Muriel Bowser in DC's mayoral primary, Ziggy has decided to run against her as a Repuplican.

His odds of defeating her in November are as good as anyone else's.

Critics say Mr. Ziggy seems confused by complex issues like Initiative 77. He seems less interested in whether restaurant workers will receive tips than whether they will bring him food, which they currently do not.

In the meantime he will play with his rabbit.
