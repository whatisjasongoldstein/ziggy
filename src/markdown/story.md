# Ziggy's story

Ziggy was born in a shelter in West Virginia but escaped hardship after being adopted through the [City Dogs Rescue](https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/) foster network. He graduated from Spot on Training University, despite incessantly barking in class.

Known for his floppy ears, extreme friendliness, and signature sea-lion bark, Ziggy immediately became a popular fixture of Shaw. He could be found trotting about, defending the neighborhood from squirrels, introducing himself to dogs and people, and poking his nose into local businesses to see if they have any treats.

Ziggy cares deeply about his community and won't rest until he's confident there's no more discarded pizza on the street, and the city works for all citizens, pointy-eared and floppy-eared alike.
